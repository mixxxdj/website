The September issue of <a href="http://computermusic.co.uk/">Computer Music</a>
 magazine features Mixxx again, this time in a half-page blurb which includes an interview with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adam Davison</span>
 about some of the challenges we've faced and where Mixxx is headed.<br />
