Do you want Mixxx translated into your language?
Mixxx 1.10.0 will be our first foray into internationalization and we need your help!
If you want Mixxx in your language, please head on over to Launchpad and [help with the translation effort](https://translations.launchpad.net/mixxx/trunk/+translations).

We're hard at work on bugfixes as the 1.10.0 development cycle is coming to a close.
Hopefully we'll have a beta for you all soon.
