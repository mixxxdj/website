Since the 2022-02-24 we receive horrible news from Ukaine, which have become even worse since than. This requires that we all speak up and show solidarity for the Ukraine.

Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine cannot be justified by anything and has already been condemned by the UN as a violation of international law. The attack creates endless suffering for men, women and children in Ukraine but also for the many young Russian soldiers who are sent by a dictator into a senseless war that they do not want, do not understand and are not even allowed to call it such.

However, starting the war is not done solely by Putin. 50 - 60 % of Russians still support Putin and his war. Putin's power is based largely on the mood of the majority of the population controlled by propaganda, misinformation and punishment of the opposition. The extent of censorship and political persecution is unprecedented in the recent Russian history.

Mixxx and the FOSS movements respects users' freedom and stands also for feedome in other regards including free speech. This should we also express in our DJ set's by integrating traks from Ukrain artist, Russian activists or anti war tracks.
