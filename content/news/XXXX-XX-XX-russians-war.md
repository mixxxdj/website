On 2022-02-24 we received horrible news from Ukraine, which has become even worse since then. As an organization committed to freedom we feel the urge speak up and show solidarity with Ukraine.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unjustified and has already been condemned by the UN as a violation of international law. The attack creates endless suffering not only for the men, women and children of Ukraine but also for the many Russian soldiers who are sent into a senseless war that they do not want, do not understand and are not even allowed to call as such.

Mixxx and the FOSS movement respect users' freedom and also stand for freedom in other regards, including free speech and worldwide peaceful collaboration. As an expression of solidarity, we suggest integrating tracks in our DJ sets from Ukrainian artists, Russian activists or by playing anti-war tracks in general.

Here three examples:

1. [Бетон - Kyiv Calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLCiA38No3Y)
2. [Океан Ельзи - Не твоя війна (Not your war)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=QFZV_j5fjEM)
3. [PROBASS ∆ HARDI - ДОБРОГО ВЕЧОРА (Where are you from?)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=wir4k8BbX_Q)
