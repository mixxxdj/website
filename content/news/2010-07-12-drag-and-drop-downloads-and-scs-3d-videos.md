**Busy week!**

I started doing more Mixxx development on **Windows** this week and I've been trying to fix lots of little bugs.
I'm pretty embarrassed at how badly [broken drag-and-drop on Windows](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/325337) was in 1.8.0 Beta 2 - Sorry about that guys, we really didn't do much testing of the library stuff on Windows before the release.
It's fixed in our 1.8 code repository, but I have no idea when we're going to make our next release.
I think that bug  pretty crippling though, so if enough people complain, I'll try to talk our Windows packager into building a **new version** for you guys.

On Saturday, we woke up to a **nice surprise** from our downloads.mixxx.org hosting provider.
They **cut off** downloads to Mixxx 1.7.2 for Win32 because we had too many requests to it!
We had a couple thousand downloads in one day, and apparently they're unable to provide us with the 5 TB of monthly bandwidth we pay them for because of CPU usage.
After scratching our heads for a while, we ended up redirecting users to a [temporary download page](http://downloads.mixxx.org/mixxx-1.7.2/mixxx-1.7.2-win32.html) with links to a mirror site and a torrent.
Big thanks to **[Mark Glines](http://www.glines.org/)** for helping us out temporarily until we find a permanent hosting solution!

Our MIDI guru, Sean Pappalardo, has put a new video this week showcasing the SCS.3d and SCS.3m MIDI controllers in action:
