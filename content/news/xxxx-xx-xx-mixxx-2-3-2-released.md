We are happy to announce second minor release of [Mixxx 2.3.2](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/releases/tag/2.3.2)!
You will find the download links [here]({filename}/pages/download.md#stable) for Windows, macOS and Linux.

This release comes with updated controller mappings and includes some bugfixes.

It improved the [Numark DJ2GO2 Touch](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/numark_dj2go2_touch.html) mapping, the [Hercules Inpulse 300](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/hercules_djcontrol_inpulse_300.html) mapping and the [Denon MC7000](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/denon_mc7000.html) mapping.

Among other minor issue this release finally fixes the random skipping of tracks from Auto DJ, a regression since Mixxx 2.3.0.

For the full list of changes, have a look at the [changelog](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/chapters/appendix/changelog.html) and the [2.3.2 milestone on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/mixxx/+milestone/2.3.2).
