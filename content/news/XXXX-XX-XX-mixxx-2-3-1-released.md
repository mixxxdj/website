We are happy to announce the release of [Mixxx 2.3.1](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/releases/tag/2.3.1)!
Head over to the [download page]({filename}/pages/download.md#stable) and download it on Windows, macOS and Linux.

This release fixes a handful of bugs and packaging issues plus adds several controller mappings.

Mixxx now includes mappings for the [Numark DJ2GO2 Touch](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/numark_dj2go2_touch.html) controller and the [Numark Mixtrack Pro FX](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/numark_mixtrack_pro_fx.html) controller. The [Behringer DDM4000](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/behringer_ddm4000.html), the [Hercules Inpulse 300](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/hercules_djcontrol_inpulse_300.html) mapping, the [Denon MC7000](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/denon_mc7000.html) mapping and the [Traktor Kontrol S3](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/hardware/controllers/native_instruments_traktor_kontrol_s3.html) mapping have been improved since Mixxx 2.3.0.

Among other minor issues, this release fixes the random skipping of tracks and the wrong track entries in the history playlist when using AutoDJ.
Both bugs are regressions that were introduced in the Mixxx 2.3.0 release.

For the full list of changes, have a look at the [changelog](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/chapters/appendix/changelog.html#v2-3-1) and the [2.3.1 milestone on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/mixxx/+milestone/2.3.1).

In case you're a Linux package maintainer please double check the [Packaging section](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/blob/2.3.1/CHANGELOG.md#packaging) in the changelog and modify your packaging script if necessary.
