*If the app running on this handheld looks vaguely familiar, that's because it's **Mixxx**!*

**[Mixxx**](http://mixxx.sf.net/) is part of the bundled software on the handheld, along with other popular apps like [Hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/) and [Ardour](http://ardour.org/).
Looks like a neat device, and could be useful for digital DJs on the move.
