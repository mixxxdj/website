We are proud to announce Mixxx 2.4, available right now, a new major version of our free open source DJ software. It took about two years since the last release due to the large number of new features and changes under the hood.

The 2.4 release includes the following highlights:

### EngineOS export

Mixxx 2.4 adds support for exporting crates, playlists and the library to Engine DJ OS devices (Denon and Numark standalone controllers).

This lets users prepare their tracks on a laptop using Mixxx and export them to a USB stick for use on a standalone controller at their gig.

### Saved Loops

Mixxx 2.4 adds support for Saved Loops.
If you already have tracks with Saved Loops from Serato DJ, Mixxx 2.4 will automatically read them from the track metadata.

### Effects

Mixxx 2.4 introduces Effect Chains, a set of effects which can be saved and reloaded with all their parameters and individual Meta Knob mappings.
Effect Chains can also be exported and imported, which allows you to share them with other DJs.
Once you've created an Effect Chain, you can define individual Super Knob mappings which allows you to use the chain as a Quick-Effect, where you take creative control with a single knob. Effect parameters can be reordered and or hidden.
In the effect units, Mixxx 2.4 also displays the value and unit of effect knob parameters while they are being adjusted.

### Track Menu

The track menu in Mixxx 2.4 is enhanced by several new features:

- Select loaded track in library
- Analyze/re-analyze with variable/constant BPM on a per-track basis
- Looking up track metadata at Discogs, Soundcoud and LastFM
- Remove track files from disk

### Sync

Mixxx 2.4 adds support for choosing the Sync Leader by clicking on the new button with the crown symbol next to the Sync button.
This mode is useful when tracks have variable BPM, all the decks with sync enabled will follow the changing BPM of the Sync Leader.
