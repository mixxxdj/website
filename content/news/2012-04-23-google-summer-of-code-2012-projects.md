The Summer of Code is upon us! Google has just [announced](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/home/google/gsoc2012/mixxx)  which students Mixxx has accepted into the **Google Summer of Code 2012** program.
Students were competing for one of four slots awarded to Mixxx by Google.
This year we received a high volume of applications from many skilled students which made the decision-making process very difficult.

After over two weeks of deliberation, we're pleased to introduce our Google Summer of Code students for 2012:

- **Matthew Mikolay** from **Rutgers University**  in the United States
- **Max Linke**  from **Georg-August-Universität Göttingen**  in Germany (irc nick: kain88)
- **Scott Stewart**  from **the**  **University of California, Berkeley**  in the United States** ** (irc nick: smstewart)
- ****Varun Jewalikar **  from the **University of Pompeu Fabra** in Spain (irc nick: neo01124)

Matthew Mikolay will build a **pass-through mode for vinyl-control users**.
This will allow DJs to seamlessly use Mixxx with their vinyl or CD collections alongside their digital collections.

Max Linke will work on improving the Mixxx library by adding a **preview player**, **multiple library paths**, and more.

Scott Stewart will pick up where a previous GSoC project left off by **enhancing our AutoDJ feature** to mix more like a DJ rather than just cross-fading tracks.
Here's to [robots imitating DJs](http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e72/EenuhS/robotdj5.png) instead of [DJs imitating robots](http://manhattan2ibiza.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/daft-punk-10.jpg)!

Last but not least, Varun Jewalikar will bring **harmonic mixing** features to Mixxx.
This includes **automatic key detection** using open-source key detection libraries, the ability to **pitch-shift tracks on the fly**, **key-sync**, support for multiple **key notations**, and more.

This summer's Google Summer of Code projects will be a huge step forward for Mixxx both in functionality and polish.
We can't wait to get these students integrated into the Mixxx community and get their work into a release.
The 4 will be mentored by our mentoring team: RJ Ryan, Bill Good, Daniel Schürmann, Owen Williams, and Albert Santoni.
As always, we're very grateful for Google's generosity in enabling this work.

Meanwhile, the Mixxx team is working full-speed ahead on Mixxx 1.11, which we hope to release in early June.
At this point all the new features are complete and we're fixing bugs. Look for a beta release in the near future!
