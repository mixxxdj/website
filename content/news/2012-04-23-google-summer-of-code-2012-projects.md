The Summer of Code is upon us! Google has just&nbsp;<a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/home/google/gsoc2012/mixxx">announced</a>
&nbsp;which students Mixxx has accepted into the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Google Summer of Code 2012</span>
&nbsp;program. Students were competing for one of four slots awarded to Mixxx by Google. This year we received a high volume of applications from many skilled students which made the decision-making process very difficult.<br />
<div><br />
<div>After over two weeks of deliberation, we're pleased to introduce our Google Summer of Code students for 2012:<br />
<ul><li><b>Matthew Mikolay </b>
from&nbsp;<b>Rutgers University</b>
&nbsp;in the United States</li>
<li><b>Max Linke</b>
&nbsp;from <b>Georg-August-Universität Göttingen</b>
&nbsp;in Germany&nbsp;(irc nick: kain88)</li>
<li><b>Scott Stewart</b>
&nbsp;from <b>the</b>
&nbsp;<b>University of California, Berkeley</b>
&nbsp;in the United States<b>&nbsp;</b>
(irc nick: smstewart)</li>
<li><b><b>Varun Jewalikar&nbsp;</b>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">from </span>
the<span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span>
<b>University of Pompeu Fabra</b>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;in Spain (irc nick: neo01124)</span>
</b>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Matthew Mikolay will build a <b>pass-through mode for vinyl-control users</b>
. This will allow DJs to seamlessly use Mixxx with their vinyl or CD collections alongside their digital collections.<br />
<br />
Max Linke will work on improving the Mixxx library by adding a <b>preview player</b>
, <b>multiple library paths</b>
, and more.<br />
<br />
Scott Stewart will pick up where a previous GSoC project left off by <b>enhancing our AutoDJ feature</b>
 to mix more like a DJ rather than just cross-fading tracks. Here's to <a href="http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e72/EenuhS/robotdj5.png" target="_blank">robots imitating DJs</a>
 instead of <a href="http://manhattan2ibiza.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/daft-punk-10.jpg" target="_blank">DJs imitating robots</a>
!<br />
<br />
Last but not least, Varun Jewalikar will bring <b>harmonic mixing </b>
features to Mixxx. This includes <b>automatic key detection</b>
 using open-source key detection libraries, the ability to <b>pitch-shift tracks on the fly</b>
, <b>key-sync</b>
, support for multiple <b>key notations</b>
, and more.<br />
<br />
This summer's Google Summer of Code projects will be a huge step forward for Mixxx both in functionality and polish. We can't wait to get these students integrated into the Mixxx community and get their work into a release. The 4 will be mentored by our mentoring team: RJ Ryan, Bill Good, Daniel Schürmann, Owen Williams, and Albert Santoni. As always, we're very grateful for Google's generosity in enabling this work.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Mixxx team is working full-speed ahead on Mixxx 1.11, which we hope to release in early June. At this point all the new features are complete and we're fixing bugs. Look for a beta release in the near future!</div>
