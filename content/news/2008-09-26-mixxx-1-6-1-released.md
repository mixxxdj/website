Hot off the heels of our last release comes [Mixxx 1.6.1]({filename}/pages/download.md), bringing a handful of new features and bug fixes.

Some of the more important changes are:

- The **waveform view now zooms** instead of speeding up when the pitch is adjusted.
  This allows the beat ticks to align when songs are beatmatched, and was a feature request we heard many times after the 1.6.0 release.
- **FLAC support for Windows users!**
  (Another much requested feature, and you can thank Michael Pujos for his hard work on this.)
- Fixed a problem where the waveform view went unresponsive (thanks to Mark Glines for the patch)
- Properly read artist and title names from FLAC files (another one from Mark)
- Fixed drag-and-drop on Windows with the "Simple" display mode.
- Fixed a Hercules RMX problem with its MIDI mapping.
- Fix for songs with short artist names.

We've also had some mild success with M4A/AAC support, but it's still going to be a while before that feature makes it into a release unfortunately.
We're also still working on our OS X 10.4 (Intel) package still, but we do have an unsupported [OS X 10.5 package for PPC available for download here](http://downloads.mixxx.org/mixxx-1.6.1/mixxx-1.6.1-macppc.dmg).
