The Mixxx Development Team is pleased to announce that **Mixxx 1.9** is [now available](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mixxx/id413756578?mt=12&ls=1) for Mac OS X through the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mixxx/id413756578?mt=12&ls=1)!

We're excited to be one of the first open source applications in the Mac App Store, and grateful for the opportunity to share Mixxx with an even wider audience.
This new release brings improved iTunes integration, and exclusive to the App Store, a new audio decoder that harnesses Core Audio to bring **M4A playback support** to Mixxx.

A full release announcement including a list of [changes]({filename}/news/2010-12-06-mixxx-190-beta1-and-182-released.md) included in 1.9 will be posted in the next few days, as we're still finalizing Windows and Linux packages.
We're also putting [our build server]({filename}/news/2010-12-24-build-server-fundraiser-a-success-thank-you.md) to good use these days, and will have an update on that project soon.
Stay tuned!
