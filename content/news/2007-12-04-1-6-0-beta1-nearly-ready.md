I know this has been rather a painful wait for some people who have been anticipating great things from the 1.6.0 series. So I thought I'd just post to say that we are nearly there. I can only speak for the Windows release personally but I'm now about 90% sure that this will be out by the end of December.<br />

If you simply can't wait any longer then you might like to sign up to our <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel">mailing list</a>
. Some pre-beta binaries are starting to circulate there for those who are willing to test the latest version of Mixxx and provide feedback.<br />
