<div style="text-align: left;">In less than 48 hours since we <a href="{filename}/news/2011-02-20-mixxx-19-now-available-in-mac-app-store.md">went live</a>
, <b>Mixxx has become the #1 Top Free App</b>
 in the USA, Germany, and Italy. We're also one of the top 3 Apps in Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, and the UK.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">We're completely overwhelmed by the response - I don't think anyone saw this coming. We wanted to be in the Mac App Store to reach more users, and now we're reaching far more than we ever expected!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">I'd like to thank our entire community of DJs, artists, and developers for their dedication and cooperation that have brought Mixxx this far. Without the devotion of <a href="{filename}/contact.md">many individuals</a>
, Mixxx would not be the software it is today.<br />

<b>Feed a Hungry Mixxx Developer</b>

As a shameless plug, I'm finishing my degree next month and <a href="http://www.santoni.ca/albert/">I'm looking for a job</a>
! I'm interested in pursuing a career in game development or <a href="http://www.mixxx.org/">live performance audio software</a>
. If you know someone who needs a C++ programmer with several years of experience with Qt or real-time audio, <a href="mailto:alberts@mixxx.org">please let me know</a>
!<br />
