We've got some <span style="font-weight: bold;">bad news about the Mac PPC version of 1.6.0</span>
. Due to a "communication error", I thought we had someone building a PPC release and it turns out that person was actually doing something completely different. Unfortunately, I also promised erroneously to some people on the forums that it would be ready very soon.<br />
<br />
So the situation is this, it seems that building a PPC release is beyond our available resources currently, as few of our current developers have access to such hardware. As such, we are <span style="font-weight: bold;">urgently seeking someone to fill the role of PPC packager</span>
 for Mixxx, this person will need access to a PPC Mac, some expertise in building software on it and some spare time. We will support this person to the best of our ability and they <span style="font-weight: bold;">will be recognised as an official member of the development team </span>
on our website. We may also be able to pay in Mixxx branded t-shirts or mousemats. :)<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested in this, <a href="http://www.mixxx.org/contact.php">please contact us using any of the usual methods.</a>
<br />
<br />
So again, apologies to all those PPC Mac users out there who were misled, this was an honest mistake and we feel quite bad. Hopefully we will have a PPC release for you soon.<br />
<br />
Sorry,<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>
We've had several volunteers come forward, and we're working with them to get a PPC build working. How long this will take depends on how much time the volunteers have, so I don't a package very soon, but at least the gears are turning now. :) Thanks for your help!
