Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
While we're hard at work on Mixxx v1.9, we're going to order a batch of Mixxx T-shirts for you to buy but we need something cool to put on them. The plain Mixxx logo would look awesome, but we wanted to open this up to you, our users and fans to see what you come up with that might be even better. The winning design will end up on the shirts and the submitter of the winning design will receive one shirt free!<br />
<br />
So here are the rules: <span style="font-weight: bold;">PLEASE READ!</span>
<br />
<ul><li> The name "Mixxx" must be prominently displayed (but feel free to stylize it however you want)</li>
<li> No obscene, profane, offensive or violent graphics or text. (We want Mixxx to inspire good feelings. If you wouldn't show it to your grandmother, don't submit it.)</li>
<li> All artwork <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span>
 be original (and/or you must own the rights to use and submit it (and be able to prove it.) If you're not sure or don't have proof, don't use it.) Of course you have permission to use the Mixxx logo.</li>
<li> All submissions become property of the Mixxx development team</li>

<li>The shirts will be printed in full (process) color, so use as many colors as you like<br />
