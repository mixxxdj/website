<br />
The Mixxx development team suggests 1.6.0 is most delicious if you <a href="http://mixxx.sourceforge.net/download.php">get it while it's hot.</a>
<br />
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />
This is the first beta release of the 1.6.0 series and incorporates an enormous number of new toys, some of the highlights are:<br />
<ul><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2ZPSSXlK60">Vinyl control</a>
</li>
<li>Skin colour schemes</li>
<li>New music library</li>
<li>Better BPM detection</li>
<li>Better support for MIDI controllers</li>
<li><a href="http://mixxx.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Roadmap#Changelog">... and more</a>
</li>
</ul>
Obviously as with all beta software, expect a few problems, the following are things you may encounter:<br />
<ul><li>Various library issues, especially with regard to colour schemes and scanning/persistency</li>
<li>Ubuntu users may have trouble connecting to JACK, we are working hard on this</li>
<li>Vinyl control is not very extensively tested so please report your experiences</li>
</ul>
We desperately need your feedback to make 1.6.0 better, please report problems in any of the usual places, such as the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=47577&amp;atid=449891">bug tracker</a>
 or on mixxx-devel for those who are subscribed.<br />
<br />
We'd also like to mention that we're <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=47577">accepting donations</a>
 to help support Mixxx's development. If you enjoy the software, use it professionally, or would just like to help us out, we'd appreciate a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=47577">donation</a>
 of any size.<br />
<br />
