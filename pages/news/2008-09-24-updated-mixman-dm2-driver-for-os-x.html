<a href="http://www.joemattiello.com">Joe Mattiello</a>
 has updated his <a href="http://www.joemattiello.com/dm2/">MixMan DM2 driver for Mac OS X</a>
. From his release announcement:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
This version adds Mixxx support, which should mimic the Linux ALSA (Jan's) driver. This means it should be a drop in replacement with the same .xml config file already packaged. Note, this is different then the version for the DM2 under windows, which is a completely different setup.<br />
<br />
This version also includes a more extendable Generic MIDI mode which supports 4 banks completely and a PD patch to get you started on custom setups.<br />
