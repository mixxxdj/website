With the recent release of Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, all Mac applications are required to be<i>&nbsp;signed</i>
&nbsp;by a developer registered with Apple, otherwise it won't work out-of-the-box. This new feature in Mountain Lion is called&nbsp;<b>Gatekeeper</b>
, and gives Apple a way to stop spyware and other nasty stuff from spreading.<br />
<br />
Because of this, we recommend keeping Gatekeeper enabled, and we've produced an updated build of Mixxx 1.10.1 that's signed so it should work on Mountain Lion:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://downloads.mixxx.org/targeted/mixxx-1.10.1-macuniversal-mountainlion.dmg"><b>Download Mixxx 1.10.1 for Mac OS X Mountain Lion</b>
</a>
</div>
<br />
In the near future, we'll be working to change our release process so all packages are signed, meaning there won't be a specific version for Mountain Lion. Thanks to <a href="{% url '/news/2010-12-24-build-server-fundraiser-a-success-thank-you.html' %}">our build server</a>
, we're now able to create Mixxx releases automatically, but it still requires a fair amount of work to keep it working because Mixxx changes so fast. It's also a bit of a headache to distribute our packages to all of our mirrors, so we'll try to improve that as well.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, enjoy, and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+filebug">please file bugs</a>
 if you run into any problems on Mountain Lion!<br />
