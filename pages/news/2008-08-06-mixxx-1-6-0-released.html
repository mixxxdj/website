Mixxx 1.6.0 represents over a year's worth of hard work from our growing development team. The development of 1.6.0 was been driven by continuous feedback from our users, the bulk of which began in May 2007 with our popular user survey. Since then, we've taken the features that people wanted the most and focused every effort on developing them. Needless to say, 1.6.0 is light-years ahead of 1.5.0, and our community's continued appreciation for Mixxx has served as a strong motivator for us throughout its development.<br />
<br />
We've also <a href="http://www.mixxx.org/">relaunched our website</a>
 with a fresh coat of paint. Clicking the thumbnail above will take you to the new site.<br />
<br />
<div style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mixxx 1.6.0 is now available on our </span>
<a href="http://www.mixxx.org/download/" style="font-weight: bold;">downloads page</a>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">. </span>

<br />
We'd like to thank both <a href="http://www.hercules.com/">Hercules</a>
 and <a href="http://www.echoaudio.com/">Echo Audio</a>
 for supporting Mixxx's development. Hercules' MK2 and RMX controllers are excellent, and Echo makes fantastic professional-grade soundcards (and we mean it).<br />
<br />
If you'd like to come hang out with some of the Mixxx developers and fellow users, we're having a <a href="{% url '/news/2008-08-02-mixxx-meetup-friday-august-8th-2008-7pm-linux-caffe-toronto.html' %}">meetup at the Linuxcaffe in Toronto</a>
 on Friday, August 8th from 7 PM to 11 ish. Come check it out!<br />
<br />
Before getting to the changelog, I'd like to mention one thing - A big change we've made is that Mixxx 1.6.0 is built on the <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt 4</a>
 platform instead of Qt 3. Porting Mixxx to Qt 4 took a massive effort from many developers, and was important to modernize Mixxx's look and feel, as well as ensure that Mixxx's codebase doesn't become obsolete. We've made many technical improvements inside Mixxx in order to allow the project to grow well into the future. Mixxx is now a much more mature open source project than it was a year ago, and there's no signs of us slowing down.<br />
<br />
