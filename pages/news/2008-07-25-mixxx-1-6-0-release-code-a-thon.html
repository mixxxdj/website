It's hard to believe it's been over a year since the release of Mixxx 1.5.0, our last stable release. However, we're pleased to say that we're now <span style="font-weight: bold;">nearly ready to bring 1.6.0 out of beta</span>
.<br />
<br />
As part of the final push to get the release done, we're planning <span style="font-weight: bold;">a whole day coding/fixing/testing session next Tuesday (the 29th)</span>
. Most of the development team will be on our IRC channel (#mixxx on irc.freenode.net) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">everyone is invited</span>
 to come and join us. Whether you want to help write code, help test the release as it comes together, dj up some tunes for the development team or simply come and watch, everyone is welcome and there will be plenty to do, even for non-technical people. Things should start around 10am in Europe and run through to the evening in the Americas.<br />
<br />
Look forward to seeing you there,<br />
<br />
Adam
