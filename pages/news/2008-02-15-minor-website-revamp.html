If anyone reads our developer's mailing list, you might know I'm not a huge fan of SourceForge. We've been planning for months to move away from it, and today we've taken a big step in that direction. Our website is now located at: <b><a href="http://www.mixxx.org">www.mixxx.org</a>
</b>
<br />
<br />
We've also started using our new logo, created by <a href="http://openartist.net/">Paul Bloch of OpenArtist</a>
. He's quite talented, and is working on a more thorough overhaul of the Mixxx website to be launched sometime in the upcoming months.<br />
<br />
Among the new changes to the website are our <a href="http://www.mixxx.org/forums">new forums</a>
, and our new (and faster) <a href="http://www.mixxx.org/org">Mixxx Wiki</a>
. We're looking forward to helping the community grow on the new forums.<br />
<br />
Lastly, we're going to be using our Launchpad page's <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/">bug tracker</a>
 from now on. It's much easier to use, and isn't cluttered with 10 megabytes worth of flash ads like the old one. :)<br />
<br />
Enjoy!
