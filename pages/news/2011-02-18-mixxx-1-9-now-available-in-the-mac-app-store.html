<div style="text-align: left;">The Mixxx Development Team is pleased to announce that <b>Mixxx 1.9</b>
 is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mixxx/id413756578?mt=12&amp;ls=1">now available</a>
 for Mac OS X through the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mixxx/id413756578?mt=12&amp;ls=1">Mac App Store</a>
!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">We're excited to be one of the first open source applications in the Mac App Store, and&nbsp;grateful&nbsp;for the opportunity to share Mixxx with an even wider audience. This new release brings improved iTunes integration, and exclusive to the App Store, a new audio decoder that harnesses Core Audio to bring <b>M4A playback support</b>
 to Mixxx.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />

<div style="text-align: left;">A full release announcement including a list of <a href="{% url '/news/2010-12-06-mixxx-190-beta1-and-182-released.html' %}">changes</a>
 included in 1.9 will be posted in the next few days, as we're still finalizing Windows and Linux packages. We're also putting <a href="{% url '/news/2010-12-24-build-server-fundraiser-a-success-thank-you.html' %}">our build server</a>
 to good use these days, and will have an update on that project soon. Stay tuned!&nbsp;</div>
