Welcome to the official blog of the <a href="http://mixxx.sourceforge.net">Mixxx</a>
 project! We've been hacking away for quite some time now trying to build the best application we can for live DJing, and along the way we've had quite a few thoughts that we think are worth sharing. This blog will let us share some of those thoughts in a less formal way and will hopefully shine some light on our development process.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!
