Cedric coded up something cool yesterday:<br />

He figured out how to integrate a file browser into our new library table view. Being able to browse directories is useful if you want to load songs that are outside your library (although you can just drag-and-drop them into Mixxx from outside). It's also handy if you have an inhumanly large MP3 collection and don't want to wait for it to import into Mixxx's library.<br />
<br />
Progress towards a beta release is coming along well...
