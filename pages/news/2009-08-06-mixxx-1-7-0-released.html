With the release of 1.7.0, we've also transitioned to a more flexible development process. Because of this increased flexibility, we're already hard at work on Mixxx 1.8.0, which will feature looping and an overhauled library. With the release of 1.7.0, we're now able to spend less time incorporating support for new MIDI controllers, and more time working on the features you want the most.<br />
<br />
Mixxx's development has always been driven by constant feedback from our users. Whether you're coming up with cool ideas on our forums or even just reporting bugs, we always appreciate hearing from you. Because your feedback is so valuable, we've launched a user survey to help us figure out where you want Mixxx to go. Taking a few minutes to <a href="{% url '/news/2009-08-06-mixxx-2009-user-survey.html' %}">fill out the survey</a>
 is a easy way to help out the project and will help guide our future work.<br />
<br />
Lastly, we're always looking for new contributors, and we hope our recent move to <a href="http://www.launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>
 and <a href="http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>
 for source code management will add more transparency to our development and encourage more people to get involved. If you're a programmer and want to work with a creative, enthusiastic team, hop on our IRC channel (#mixxx on Freenode) or sign up for our <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixxx-devel">developers' mailing list</a>
