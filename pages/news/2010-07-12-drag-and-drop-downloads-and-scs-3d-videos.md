<b>Busy week!</b>
<br />
<br />
I started doing more Mixxx development on <b>Windows</b>
 this week&nbsp;and I've been trying to fix lots of little bugs. I'm pretty embarrassed at how badly <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/325337">broken drag-and-drop on Windows</a>
 was in 1.8.0 Beta 2 - Sorry about that guys, we really didn't do much testing of the library stuff on Windows before the release. It's fixed in our 1.8 code&nbsp;repository, but I have no idea when we're going to make our next release. I think that bug &nbsp;pretty crippling though, so if enough people complain, I'll try to talk our Windows packager into building a <b>new version</b>
 for you guys.<br />
<br />
On Saturday, we woke up to a <b>nice surprise</b>
 from our downloads.mixxx.org hosting provider. They <b>cut off </b>
downloads to Mixxx 1.7.2 for Win32 because we had too many requests to it! We had a couple thousand downloads in one day, and apparently they're unable to provide us with the&nbsp;5 TB of monthly bandwidth we pay them for because of CPU usage. After scratching our heads for a while, we ended up redirecting users to a <a href="http://downloads.mixxx.org/mixxx-1.7.2/mixxx-1.7.2-win32.html">temporary download page</a>
 with links to a mirror site and a torrent. Big thanks to <b><a href="http://www.glines.org/">Mark Glines</a>
</b>
 for helping us out temporarily until we find a permanent hosting solution!<br />

Our MIDI guru, Sean Pappalardo, has put a new video this week showcasing the SCS.3d and SCS.3m MIDI controllers in action:<br />
